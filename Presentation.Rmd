## Business Objective:
Increase the number of casual riders becoming members through new marketing initiatives.

\newpage

## Analysis Objective:
Utilize bikeshare data from Q1 2019 and Q1 2020 to determine trends and patterns among casual and member users to develop a new marketing strategy.

#### Data Source Citation:

*Lyft Bikes and Scooters, LLC, Divvy Bikeshare, City of Chicago, "divvy-tripdata", Q1 2019, Q1 2020*

\newpage

## Analysis Overview:
The analysis compared member and non-member data across various variables including ride length, number of rides and day of the week to determine underlying trends in the data.

## Key Insights:
  
  * Members take significantly more rides than casual users.
  * Casual riders have a much longer average ride duration.
  * Members do most of their rides on weekdays while casual riders do their most riding on weekends.

## Number of rides per weekday by membership status
We can see that members have significantly more rides overall and the distribution of rides is heavier on weekends for casual riders and heavier on weekdays for members.

## Average duration of ride by membership status and day of the week
It is clear that casual riders overall have longer ride duration than members with a spike in duration on Thursdays.

## Conclusions
  * Members use ride share as a work transportation method and therefore use it on weekdays and with a higher overall count.
  * Casual riders use the service infrequently for leisure trips, particularly on weekends. 
  * Rides linked to work tend to be shorter while leisure rides tend to last longer 

## Recommendations
  * Cyclistic should consider marketing new features to it's membership service that target the behaviors of casual riders. 
  * I recommend features that reward weekend usage of bikes for members as well as a system of point earnings that accumulate proportionally to the length of trip taken using the Cyclistic system. 
  * Casual members need a reason to purchase membership despite infrequent usage of the system. If membership is tailored to reward the behaviors of casual riders to give them a financial reason to justify the purchase, they may reconsider.
